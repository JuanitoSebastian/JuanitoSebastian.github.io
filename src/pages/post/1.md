Show business and the club scene is not that different from other industries: it too has seen a massive change from old analog solutions to new digital equipment. There are still some disc jockeys who carry a bag of vinyls from venue to venue but the majority of deejays have opted for a much more convenient solution: digital music players. Most night clubs and music venues have DJ equipment inhouse and the standard setup of the DJ booth is two Pioneer CDJ players and a mixer.
