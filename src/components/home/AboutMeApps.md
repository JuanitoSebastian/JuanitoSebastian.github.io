I have worked on a variety of different coding projects, some at the university and some on my spare time. <a href="https://github.com/JuanitoSebastian/FinnishPassphrases" target="_blank" class="underline">Finnish Passphrases</a> is a macOS menu bar application that generates secure passphrases in Finnish. The app is written in Swift and SwiftUI. While creating this project, I wanted to learn about testing practices in the Swift ecosystem. The project features both unit and UI testing using the XCTest framework. The project also features a GitHub Actions pipeline which runs the tests and lints the code.

<a href="https://github.com/JuanitoSebastian/HKI-Bike-Buddy" target="_blank" class="underline">HKI Bike Buddy</a> is an iOS app for viewing real-time information about city bike stations in Helsinki, Espoo and Vantaa. Instead of having to search a map to find the nearest bike rental stations, HKI Bike Buddy shows the stations as a list, ordered from closest to furthest from your current location. This was my first bigger Swift project I worked with, and I really liked working with Xcode and SwiftUI. In this project I also experimented with WidgetKit and the user can add a bike station widget to their home screen.
