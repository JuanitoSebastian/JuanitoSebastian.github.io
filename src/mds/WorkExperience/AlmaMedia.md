I develop the digital services of Iltalehti: a nationwide media outlet with the largest digital reach in Finland. In my work, I write code for Iltalehti.fi, embeds such as Verokone or Ylioppilashaku, and digital tools used by journalists for news content creation. Key achievements:

- Led the successful migration of Iltalehti.fi React application from v16 to v18, enabling SSR streaming and improving developer experience.
