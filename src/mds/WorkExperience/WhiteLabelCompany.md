As the lead technical producer at [Valkoinen sali](https://www.valkoinensali.com), I managed all audio, lighting, video, and networking operations for the venue. My responsibilities included overseeing production meetings with clients, leading a team of technicians, managing equipment rentals with technical partners, ensuring compliance with technical riders, and executing lighting and sound operations. I also played a central role in client communication, ensuring the seamless technical execution of their events. Notable achievements include:

- Successfully managed the technical production for the busiest Christmas season in company history, overseeing over 50 events in just three months (October 2019 - December 2019).
- Led the technical production of a two-day festival twice (Bassline Festival 2018 and Bassline Festival 2019).
