Katang MGMT Oy operates two nightclubs in central Helsinki: [Babylon Club & Garden](https://babylonhki.fi) and [Rooftop Miami](https://www.rooftopmiami.fi). As Chief Technical Manager, I was responsible for the technical production and operation of both venues. I also helped manage the websites, Google Workspace emails and social media accounts of the company.

Some of my accomplishments and duties at Katang MGMT Oy include:

- Design and execution of the Babylon Club & Garden website in cooperation with our graphic designer.
- Managing and growing the social media presence of both of our venues on Instagram and Facebook
- Collaborate closely with our technical partners to design the technical setup for both venues.
