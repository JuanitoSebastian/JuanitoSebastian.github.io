Hi! I'm Juan, a front-end developer crafting web experiences at Iltalehti, Finland's largest digital media outlet. My previous career in technical event production equipped me with a unique blend of skills I bring to software development: proven **project management** expertise and a track record of **delivering under pressure**. Currently expanding into full-stack development while pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at the University of Helsinki, I combine technical expertise with strong collaborative skills to build robust, scalable web solutions.
