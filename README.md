# Portfolio page: [juan.fi](https://www.juan.fi)
My personal portfolio webpage. The page contains a brief description about me and my work history. There is also a section for blog posts.

The site is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The webpage is deployed to GitHub Pages with a custom domain.
